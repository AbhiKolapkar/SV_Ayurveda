    question: "What is Panchakarma?",
    answer: `The process of cleansing the body inside out with the help of ayurvedic medication helps to throw out toxins [doshas and malas] from the body and helps to get rid and fight of an existing disease.`,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Are panchakarma and massage/spa the same?",
    answer: `No. They are not the same; panchakarma is a scientific medical method that should be performed with the supervision and guidance of a qualified medical specialist. It has 5 fundamental categories [vamanam, virechanam, nasyam, basti, and raktamokshanam]. A brief pre-procedure called SNEHANAM-SWEDANAM is performed before beginning several panchakarmas.`,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Can I do panchakarma? Is it mandatory for every disease?",
    answer: `Panchakarma can be done in all age groups, including patients as well as healthy persons too, but only if advised by an ayurvedic Vaidya/Physician. The doctor will only determine and inform the patient that panchakarmas are necessary to treat an illness or maintain a healthy state of body and mind after a personal physical assessment.`,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How many days it takes to complete a panchakarma session?",
    answer: `Typically, panchakarma treatments are scheduled following a comprehensive physical evaluation. The minimum duration is seven days, although individual sessions can last up to twenty-one days or longer depending on the needs of the patient. Before beginning, the patient will receive all the details and a plan for his or her panchakarma session.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "If I do panchakarma, can I avoid medicines?",
    answer: `No. Panchakarma simply detoxifies the body [SHODHANA], it does not alter how the doshas in the body create those poisons. Ayurvedic medication is just as crucial as panchakarma for stopping the cycle of recreating the same doshas (SHAMANA) and avoiding returning to the same diseased condition (APUNARBHAVA).`,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Any dos and don’ts?",
    answer: "Yes. That will be explained at the time of panchakarma session.",
